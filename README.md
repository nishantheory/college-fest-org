# college-fest-organiser.
## Involves building a dynamic web-application for managing the events organised on behalf of a college/organisation on one go.
* The word 'fest/event' sounds really intresting especially when we involve in managing the event.</br>

* This can be done by organising an EVENT/FEST for the college where all the students of the organisation/college generally involve in several tasks(where the tasks can be academic/non-academic).</br>

* Organising the event is sometimes a **Nail-biting task** ,managing the registrations,requirements,necessities,etc...with the only aim to make the college-event successful and to give 100% throughput.</br>

* This can be done by building and maintaining a ***college-fest-organiser*** that reduces most of the burden to be handled by the fest/event manager.The only thing to do is to sit and maintain the criteria,functionality of the event on finger-tips.</br>
